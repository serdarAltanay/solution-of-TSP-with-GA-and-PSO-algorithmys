# Solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization

## Overview

This project compares the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The comparison is performed using execution time, convergence behavior, and solution quality, based on different datasets.

### Files

- **tspGA:** Genetic Algorithm implementation
- **tspPSO:** Particle Swarm Optimization implementation
- **comparison.py:** Compares GA and PSO with time and matplotlib libraries, generating graphs for execution time and convergence.
- **distances.py:** Contains distance matrices for 6, 10, 15, and 20 cities. Modify comments in the file to test different matrices.

## 1. Methods

### 1.a) Genetic Algorithm (GA)

The Genetic Algorithm is inspired by natural selection and genetics. The key steps are:

**Pseudocode:**

1. Initialize population with random individuals.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual.
3. While termination condition not met:
   - Select parents based on fitness.
   - Apply crossover to create offspring.
   - Apply mutation for variation.
   - Evaluate offspring fitness.
   - Select individuals for the next generation.
4. Return the best solution.

### 1.b) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is inspired by social behaviors, such as bird flocking or fish schooling.

**Pseudocode:**

1. Initialize swarm with random positions and velocities.
2. For each particle, calculate fitness and set:
   - **pBest:** Particle's best position.
   - **gBest:** Global best position in the swarm.
3. Repeat until termination condition:
   - Update velocity and position.
   - Evaluate fitness of the new position.
   - Update **pBest** and **gBest**.
4. Return **gBest** as the best solution.

### 1.c) Implementation for TSP

- **Encoding:**
  Each individual (GA) or particle (PSO) represents a tour (permutation of cities). For example, `[0, 3, 1, 2, 4]` represents a tour starting and ending at city 0.

- **Fitness Calculation:**
  Fitness is determined by the total distance of the tour, calculated using a distance matrix.

- **Termination:**
  Algorithms stop after a significant number of iterations.

- **GA Specific Steps:**

  - **Selection:** Tournament selection.
  - **Crossover:** Two-point crossover.
  - **Mutation:** Swap mutation.

- **PSO Specific Steps:**
  - **Initialization:** Random positions and velocities for particles.
  - **Other steps:** Follow standard PSO pseudocode.

## 2. Results and Analysis

### 2.a) Solution Quality

**Outputs generated by `comparison.py` for 500 iterations:**

| Runs | Cities | Overall Best GA Distance | Overall Best PSO Distance |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 20   | 10     | 185                      | 186                       |
| 40   | 10     | 184                      | 184                       |
| 20   | 20     | 1100                     | 1185                      |
| 40   | 20     | 1091                     | 1211                      |

### 2.b) Execution Time

**Average execution times for 500 iterations:**

| Cities | GA Time (s) | PSO Time (s) |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| 10     | 0.0181      | 0.0395       |
| 20     | 0.0258      | 0.0788       |

_GA consistently runs faster, approximately 3x faster than PSO._

### 2.c) Convergence Behavior

- **10 Cities:** PSO converges faster to the solution.
- **20 Cities:** GA is more effective with larger problem sizes.

## 3. Conclusion

The TSP was solved using both GA and PSO, and the methods were compared in terms of solution quality, execution time, and convergence behavior.

- **Execution Time:** GA consistently outperforms PSO, running nearly 3x faster.
- **Solution Quality:** GA finds slightly better solutions for larger datasets, while both perform similarly for smaller datasets.
- **Convergence:** PSO converges faster for smaller datasets, but GA is more effective as the problem size increases.

Overall, GA proves to be more efficient and effective, especially for larger TSP datasets.
